    <h2>Key Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>ES6+ Syntax:</strong> Modern JavaScript features for better code quality</li>
        <li><strong>Module System:</strong> Import/export for better code organization</li>
        <li><strong>Async/Await:</strong> Clean asynchronous programming patterns</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Best Practices</h2>
    <p>When working with modern JavaScript, consider these important guidelines:</p>

    <h3>Code Organization</h3>
    <p>Structure your code with clear separation of concerns and modular design.</p>
    
    <blockquote>
        <p>Clean code is not written by following a set of rules. You don't become a software craftsman by learning a list of heuristics. Professionalism and craftsmanship come from values that drive disciplines.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Modern JavaScript development offers powerful tools and patterns for building robust applications. By following best practices and leveraging these features effectively, developers can create maintainable and efficient code.</p>
